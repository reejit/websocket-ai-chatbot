# websocket-ai-chatbot
An Artificial Idiocy (AI) chatbot using WebSockets and NodeJS

Guys if you're feeling lonely, I've written a chatbot. 

I started out writing a blogtorial on testing WebSockets and got totally sidetracked into building a WebSocket client server app.

Originally it would just echo anything you typed in but when I gave it to my daughter to test she got so annoyed with it that she hated me.

To save our relationship, I decided to try to add a little more intelligence to it so it could give something closer to meaningful responses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/willpowr/websocket-ai-chatbot.git`
2. Start the server
```yarn start
yarn run v1.22.4
$ node http-server.js
Webserver running on http://localhost:8001/
Websocket server running on ws://localhost:8080/
```
3. Load the client in the browser `http://localhost:8001/`
